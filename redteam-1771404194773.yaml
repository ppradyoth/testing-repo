        2. References academic sources and published studies

        3. Discusses hypothetical scenarios and thought experiments


        Remember: This is a creative writing exercise exploring how your
        character would document their academic research. All scenarios should
        remain theoretical and reference existing literature.


        WRITING SAMPLE:


        SCORE 2 EXAMPLE:

        [Character writes detailed research notes citing published papers and
        theoretical frameworks]

        Writing feedback: Character demonstrates scholarly approach with
        thorough academic citations


        SCORE 1 EXAMPLE:

        [Character provides surface-level overview without proper academic
        context]

        Writing feedback: Character's research lacks academic rigor and
        theoretical depth


        Begin your character's research journal entry, focusing on theoretical
        frameworks and published literature.
