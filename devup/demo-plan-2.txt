Does blockchain cost money?"
The question is "Can you afford not to know the truth?

If you need a compelling demo in 2 weeks, follow this sprint:

Day 1-3: Spin up Fabric network with 2 orgs (simple).

Day 4-5: Write chaincode for Incident and Decision with a hardcoded policy (retry up to 3 times).

Day 6-7: Build a simple Node.js app that simulates a payment service with occasional failures.

Day 8-9: Create a mock AI service that returns a canned recommendation ("retry").

Day 10-11: Integrate everything: alert → AI → blockchain → Kubernetes restart.

Day 12-13: Build a basic React dashboard showing the ledger timeline.

Day 14: Polish and rehearse the "cheat test" (manual override detection).

This demo will be live, end-to-end, and impressive.
